cleanup code
add types (to ast and ir)
add arrays + string

visualise simulation, pretty much like a debugger


add a lot more tests

!!!! simplify the type system
    like you can always do r.u64 = r1.u64 + r2.u64 for all int types

    == != (just check if the values are equal for every type)
    + - *  (these should work with r.u64 = r1.u64 op r2.u64) (but not for floats)
    
    <= >= < > (I think for unsigned types it works like above but for signed you have to check each) (nop for floats)
    / % (have to check for each type)

    division does not work (-2 / 2)

    !! simplify casting

    do pointer arithmetic multiplication  by type before sim
